INTRODUCTION                                                         *crashcart*

Feed all or part of a stacktrace into this plugin and it will open a new tab
with each level of the stacktrace in a new vsplit. This can be useful for
seeing more context around an exception or to quickly edit offending files.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                              *crashcart-limitations*

1. Only Python stacktraces are recognized, but this can be extended via the 
   |crashcart_regexes| setting.
2. If a stack trace contains relative paths, they must be relative to Vim's
   current working directory.
3. Signs are not removed after being placed.
4. Signs may have conflicting ID's due to 3 or if you try to open multiple
   stacktraces at once.
4. Stacktraces must contain a file and a line number on the same line.

OPTIONS                                                      *crashcart-options*

|crashcart_mapkey|    shortcut to launch crashcart default <leader>s
|crashcart_showsigns| whether or not to show signs on stacktrace lines
|crashcart_regexes|   regexes for finding files/lines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *crashcart_mapkey*
Values: string
Default: <leader>s

Press this combination with a visual selection (or in normal mode followed by
a motion) to edit 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *crashcart_showsigns*
Values: 0 or 1
Default: 1

If this is set to 1, crashcart will put a |sign| on lines in the stacktrace.
These signs will be visible in any window in the current vim session showing
that file.

                                                             *crashcart_regexes*
Format: [[regex, filegroup, linegroup]... ]

regex 		should match lines in a stacktrace that contain filepath and
		line number. Filepath and line number should be captured in 
		groups (parens) 
filegroup	which group number contains the file path
linegroup	which group number contains the line

Setting this option will overwrite the default rather than adding to it.
